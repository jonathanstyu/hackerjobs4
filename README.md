# HackerJobs 4

This app is a refresh of the original HackerJobs app that I wrote a while ago.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

It works the same way as the old one. It pulls down the "whoishiring" threads by finding the account that pins the main thread. People can drill down into the individual threads and see jobs that they will eventually be able to save.

I wanted this to be run with few dependencies and it is structured as such.
